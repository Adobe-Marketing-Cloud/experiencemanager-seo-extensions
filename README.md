# SEO Extensions fo Adobe CQ5

## SEO Toolbox
The SEO Toolbox provides a UI widget that guides authors to optimize their pages for search engines. Since the list of potential criteria for SEO can be arbitrarily long, the SEO Toolbox is built with pluggability in mind. Each plugin, called an "SEO Tool" can contribute a number of criteria that an author needs to check and it can provide a UI to help fix any problems that were detected.

## SEO Tools aka Plugins
Currently the SEO Toolbox includes two SEO Tools. One helps an author to use coherent wording in titles and the page's URL handle. The other helps detecting similar pages within the same site and provides links to any detected duplicates.

## TODOs
* sidekick button registration should be decoupled from open/close action frame
* wrap seo toolbox into jQuery plugin
* define SEO Tools jQuery plugin contract for extensions
